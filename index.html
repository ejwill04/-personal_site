        <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.</p>

      <h2>about</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm a software developer based in Denver, Colorado.  I'm currently learning all I can about front-end development at Turing School of Software & Design in Downtown Denver.
      </p>

      <p>
        Prior to my transition into making sweet code, I spent five years helping other companies accomplish their goals through financing and strategic advice giving.  While I loved hob-nobbing with powdered wigs and loved all of the experience I gained, I knew I had a calling to build something great for myself.
      </p>

      <p>
        This realization pushed me to learn to code and eventually to finding the amazing community of passionate developers and designers at Turing.  I'll graduate from the program in May 2017 ready to find an awesome team wanting to make the world a better place than we found it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'd love to hear from you!  Please reach out to me at one of the channels below to get the conversation going!
