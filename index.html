      <h2>about</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm a software developer based in Denver, Colorado.  I'm currently learning all I can about front-end development at Turing School of Software & Design in Downtown Denver.
      </p>

      <p>
        Prior to my transition into making sweet code, I spent five years helping other companies accomplish their goals through financing and strategic advice giving.  While I loved hob-nobbing with powdered wigs and loved all of the experience I gained, I knew I had a calling to build something great for myself.
      </p>

      <p>
        This realization pushed me to learn to code and eventually to finding the amazing community of passionate developers and designers at Turing.  I'll graduate from the program in May 2017 ready to find an awesome team wanting to make the world a better place than we found it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'd love to hear from you!  Please reach out to me at one of the channels below to get the conversation going!
